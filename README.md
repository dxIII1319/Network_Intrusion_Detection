# Network_Intrusion_Detection
Network intrusion detection system using the NSL-KDD dataset.

This is a Network intrusion detection system. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used so as to train models on pre-existing datasets so that it can identify malicious and avoid or refuse connections to the same so as to minimize risk of cyber attacks.
We used the NSL-KDD dataset to train our model as it contained more realistic and relevant examples in our case, and therefore proved to be the better choice for us.

We tried various models like LSTM, multilayer peerceptron and more to identify which model works the best and gives us the best result. 
Our best result was the recall score of 0.9904 through LSTM.
